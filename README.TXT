This was a school project in Java assigned to me at my last term using
BlueJ. I will be posting this in case it happens to help someone. The
project itself is in Greek, but feel free to make an changes or have it
translated. 

The first field is for the number of players ACTIVE and the
second field is for the number of players ON THE BENCH.
